## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

- Pyspark 3.0
- httpagentparser: pip install httpagentparser
- user_agents: pip install pyyaml ua-parser user-agents

Apart from above, there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
