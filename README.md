## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For the project I used Stack Overflow data from 2019 and applied the CRISP-DM process to answer the following questions about programming languages:

1. What programming languages are popular today?
2. What programming languages do participants want to learn?
3. Is it possible to identify a trend in programming languages?

This project is part of the Udacity Data Science nanodegree.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis including descriptions in markdown cells and visuals. The CRISP-DM process is explained.

The dataset from Stackoverflow can be found in the folder "data".

The relevant charts were exported to the folder "charts".


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@michael.hartmann.2065/this-is-the-next-big-thing-in-coding-43c0648ae68e).
